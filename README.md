Used Cars Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
Problem Statement:
There is a huge demand for used cars in the Indian Market today. As the sale of the new car has slowed down in the recent past, the pre-owned car market has continued to grow over the past year and is larger than the new car market now. Consider this: In 2018-19, while new car sales were recorded at 3.6 million units, around 4 million second-hand cars were bought and sold. There is a slowdown in new car sales and that could mean that the demand is shifting toward the pre-owned market. In fact, some car sellers replace their old cars with pre-owned cars instead of buying new ones.

The goal here is to predict the Price of an Old car based on the variables provided in the data set.

Working with Data
Data has been split into two groups and provided in the module:
 training set
 test set
The training set is used to build our machine-learning model. For the training set, we provide the price of a car (also known as the variable Price) for each participant.

The test set should be used to see how well our model performs on unseen data. For the test set, it is our job to predict the price of the car (Price) for each participant.
